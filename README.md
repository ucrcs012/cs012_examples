cs012_examples
==============

The CS012(v) examples repository has pieces of code to utilize as teaching 
supplements. Code may not be complete programs so it may require you to pull the
pieces together into an actual program to execute it.

Once the workspace is created, you can utilize two terminal commands. The first
will pull all new files or modifications and incorporate them into your
Cloud 9 workspace. The second will reset all files you have modified to the 
versions that exist in the primary repository (overwriting without confirming).

* git pull
* git checkout -f


As the quarter progresses examples may be added for you to utilize or view. You
will utilize the above "git pull" whenever you wish to check and see if there
is anything new for you to "grab".


To go back to the top level home directory we utilize an aliased command "home".
